# Integrating B2C feature of Microsoft identity platform with a Python web application

## About this sample

This sample was initially developed as a web app to demonstrate how to
[integrate Microsoft identity platform with a Python web application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/web-app-quickstart?pivots=devlang-python).

The same code base can also be used to demonstrate how to integrate Azure Active Directory B2C
in a Python web application. You need to follow a few different steps and register your app in your
own B2C tenant, and then feed those different settings into the configuration file of this sample.
Follow the steps in [Configure authentication in a sample Python web app by using Azure AD B2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/configure-authentication-sample-python-web-app).
