# Integrating Microsoft Identity Platform with a Python web application

This is a Python web application that uses the Flask framework and the Microsoft identity platform to sign in users and make authenticated calls to the Microsoft Graph API.

To get started with this sample, you have two options:

* Use the Azure portal to create the Azure AD applications and related objects. Follow the steps in
  [Quickstart: Add sign-in with Microsoft to a Python web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/web-app-quickstart?pivots=devlang-python).
* Use PowerShell scripts that automatically create the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you, and then modify the configuration files. Follow the steps in the [App Creation Scripts README](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md).
