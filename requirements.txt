# cachelib==0.1  # Only need this if you are running Python 2
# Note: This sample does NOT directly depend on cachelib.
# It is an indirect dependency of flask-session.
# Cachelib 0.1.1 no longer supports Python 2
# (see also https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/issues/14)
# So, if you still need to run your app in Python 2,
# your workaround is to pin cachelib to its older version 0.1,
# but keep in mind it contains a known bug https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/pull/12
