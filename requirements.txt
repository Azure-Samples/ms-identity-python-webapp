# Flask 1.* used to work, until their upstream package brought in a breaking change https://github.com/pallets/markupsafe/issues/286
Flask>=2,<3

werkzeug==2.0
flask-session>=0.3.2,<0.5
requests>=2,<3
msal>=1.7,<2

# cachelib==0.1  # Only need this if you are running Python 2
# Note: This sample does NOT directly depend on cachelib.
# It is an indirect dependency of flask-session.
# Cachelib 0.1.1 no longer supports Python 2
# (see also https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/issues/14)
# So, if you still need to run your app in Python 2,
# your workaround is to pin cachelib to its older version 0.1,
# but keep in mind it contains a known bug https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/pull/12
